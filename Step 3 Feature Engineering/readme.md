# Data Acquization -> Text Preprocess -> Feature Engineering

1. What is Feature Engineering [Text Extraction/ Text Representation] from text?
- Text extraction means finding and picking out useful parts from a big text.
- Text representation is about turning text into numbers or patterns that a computer can work with.
2. Why do we need it?
- We need text extraction and text representation in NLP because computers canâ€™t understand text the way humans do. These techniques help us turn raw text into a format that computers can process and make sense of.
3. Why is it difficult?
- Images to numbers is easy => bcz pixels is built from numbers
- Audio to number is easy -> based on there frequency
- text to number is diffcult

**Technique**:
- one hot encoding
- bag of words
- Ngrams
- Tf-Idf
- word2vec [Embeddings]
- Custom feature's
